# Flutter Image Asset Generator

A simple [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension which helps you generate your image assets in 1x, 2x, and 3x and simply added them to your pubspec.yaml file.

## Usage

After installing the extension, you should see a new option has been added your context menu when you right click on any folder inside the `Explorer` section named `Flutter Image Assets: Generate`:

<p align='center'>
	<img
		src='https://github.com/devmuaz/flutter-image-assets/blob/master/assets/preview.png?raw=true'
		title='Flutter Image Assets Preview'
		alt='Flutter Image Assets Preview'
	/>
</p>

Click on it and select the image you want to add.. after that, the selected image will be scaled down to 1x, 2x, and 3x in seprated directories.

	<img
		src='https://github.com/devmuaz/flutter-image-assets/blob/master/assets/preview2.png?raw=true'
		title='Flutter Image Assets Preview'
		alt='Flutter Image Assets Preview'
	/>
</p>

## Known Issues

Currently, this extension only generates the scaled images.. but not adding them to the `pubspec.yaml` file so you have to add them yourself.. and it will be added soon as possible.
